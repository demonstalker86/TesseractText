My room

This is my room. It is large. This is my table.
| have got a radio set. It is new. It is good. It is
small. It is black. It is on my table. My lamp is
on the table. It is round. It is green. My pen is
blue. My pencil and my pen are on the table.
Now | am at school. Today | have got many
lessons. | go to school five days: on Monday,
on Tuesday, on Wednesday, on Thursday, on
Friday. And on Saturday and on Sunday I am at
home.
