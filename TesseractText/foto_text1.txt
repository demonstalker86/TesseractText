brought her a red rose,” cried the young student,
“put there is not a single red rose in all my gar-
den.”

heard him, and she looked out through the leaves
and wondered.

“Not a single red rose in all my garden!” cried the
student, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.
“Happiness depends so much on such little things!
I have read all that the wise men have written, I
know all the secrets of philosophy, but my life is
unhappy because I have no red rose.”
